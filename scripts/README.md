# ⚙️ Slurm Scripts for Batch Jobs on ClinWulf

This folder will contain Slurm job submission scripts for running **regular batch jobs** on the ClinWulf HPC cluster at Stony Brook University.

These jobs may include:
- ✅ Python scripts
- ✅ Shell jobs
- ✅ Jobs using custom Conda environments

## 🚧 Coming Soon

We’re currently working on adding reusable and customizable script templates for:

- [ ] Python batch jobs (`run_python_script.sh`)
- [ ] Shell jobs with resource control
- [ ] Custom Conda environment setup instructions

---

Stay tuned! If you have specific script requests or formats you'd like supported, feel free to contribute or open an issue in the main repository.
